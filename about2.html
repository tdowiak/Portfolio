    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>A self-taught web developer in Pittsburgh, PA, I earned my  B.S. in
      Materials Science and Engineering from Penn State University. After 2
      years of working in heavy manufacturing and steel, I decided to change
      career paths. I've always enjoyed the challenge of coding and finally
      asked myself, "why not pursue this as a career?" I've since spent the last
      few months teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and look forward
      to using my new skills in a professional setting as a web developer.
