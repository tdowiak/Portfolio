    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>A self-taught web developer in Pittsburgh, PA, I earned my  B.S. in
      Materials Science and Engineering from Penn State University. After 2
      years of working in heavy manufacturing and steel, I realized it just wasn't
      for me. I've always enjoyed the challenge of coding and finally decided to
      commit myself to a career as a developer.  I've been spending the last several
      months teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java and look forward
      to putting my new skills to use in a professional setting.
